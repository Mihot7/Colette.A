<br> Do not run on a real pc!
This is a Trojan smple that I wrote for educational purposes.
<br>
# ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS 9X
<br>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<br>
Firstly, It creates a new dir C:\drivers and copies infect.vbs as S3.VBS.
<br>
Then, it overwrites current win.ini with a polish (for more corruption) copy that runs trojan every boot
<br>
Lastly, it displays fake error message.
<br>
So.. after that it runs every time your boot your pc.
<br>
Every time it's ran it checks if the day is 5th of any month.
<br>
If it is, it corrupts every single non-used file in C:\WINDOWS & C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM.
<br>
How are files corrupted?
<br>
It replaces the file with its own copy but, it doesn't change the expantion.
<br>
So, you have a .exe file that is accualy now a .vbs but it can't open becuse of the wrong expantion :D
<br>
And the OS will no longer boot!
